<p>In Lucknow, you can find great Ayodhya packages with a flat 20% off on your first booking. These packages take you to Ayodhya, one of India&#8217;s most sacred places. You&#8217;ll visit important sites like the Ram Janmabhoomi, Hanuman Garhi, and the Kanak Bhawan temple. It&#8217;s a spiritual journey where you can immerse yourself in the city&#8217;s rich culture and history. These packages include comfortable accommodations and guided tours, making your pilgrimage experience enriching and hassle-free.</p>
<p>Naimisharanya (also known as Neemsar) is a special place near Lucknow, on the banks of the River Gomti. It&#8217;s steeped in Hindu mythology and believed to be where many Hindu gods and goddesses reside. People say that doing penance here for 12 years can take you to Brahmaloka. You can explore various shrines on a day trip, thanks to a paved street that connects them.</p>
<p>Varanasi is one of the oldest cities in the world and has a rich history. It was a major city even in ancient times, known for its silk fabrics, perfumes, and more. It&#8217;s also famous for its religious significance. You can visit Sarnath nearby, where Buddha gave his first sermon. Varanasi has been a hub of religious, educational, and artistic activities for centuries.</p>
